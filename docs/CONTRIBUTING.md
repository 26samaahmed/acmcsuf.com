## Getting Started

Getting started with this project is quite simple.
There really are only a handful of simple steps.

1. Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine.
1. Clone the repository.
1. Install the dependencies and contribute.

First, make sure that Node.js is **installed** on your machine in order to run our code.
If you do not have Node.js installed, visit their [downloads page][node_dl] and install the latest long-term supported version.

To contribute to this project, you may simply begin by **cloning** this repository to your machine.
Clone this repository by [directly downloading it][ddl] or via git: `git clone https://github.com/EthanThatOneKid/acmcsuf.com.git`.

Open the repository in your code editor or terminal of choice and enter `npm i` to **install** the project's dependencies.
After that, enter `npm run dev` to spin up the development server.
As the development server is running, open up [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/).
Every update made to the source code will trigger your `http://localhost:3000/` page to reload automatically.

Now that you've got everything up-and-running, you are free to contribute to your heart's content.
