- Introduced shadows

// Additions made
- Social media icon available
- Added text logos

// Which filetype to use
2 filetypes are provided: PNG and SVG

It's preferred to use SVG so that the icon doesn't compress as much when
resized to be smaller.  Use PNG for anything else

// How to use the Badges
2 folders are provided: with shadow and without shadow

It's preferred to use the without shadow variations and to manually
add shadows*

This is because the ones w/ shadows already don't perfectly center the
badge since the dimensions account for the shadows makes them technically
uneven
- ex. w/o shadow is 316*316, w/ shadows is 350*350

Use the shadow versions if it's for the website favicon or only if necessary
- ex. unable to add shadows manually

*Shadows will always be between 8 and 24px for the y-axis, depending on
how large or small you make the badge if resizing.  The spread/blur uses
the following equation
- y-axis + (y-axis / 2)
	~ ex) y-axis = 10, spread = 10 + (10/2) = 15

If you want some clarifications on how to use these or something,
then dm me on instagram or discord.  Instagram if you want an
almost instant response

// Upcoming release
- Add visual branding guidelines
